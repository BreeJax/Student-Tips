# Alumni Advice for Before the Program

1. Settle everything before hand.  Don't be like me and put off finishing your dissertation till after the program starts.  It's just an added stress.  Get to the doctor, the bank, the mechanic, etc before it starts.  

2. Do the pre work and then some.  I recommend the Codecademy's [_git_ and _command line_](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/bash) free courses. These are easy and will help you immensely if you are acquainted with the language and features before hand.
